The code is tested on Ubuntu 14.04 using NVIDIA  Titan X GPU and MATLAB R2014b. The recent release on 12/15/17 includes the implementation of our BMVC paper using matrix normalization. The implementation of bilinear pooling layers and matirx normalization layers are wrapped into a separate [bcnn-package](https://bitbucket.org/tsungyu/bcnn-package).

### Installation


This code depends on [VLFEAT](http://www.vlfeat.org) and [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) and [bcnn-package](https://bitbucket.org/tsungyu/bcnn-package). They are pre-defined as submodules for this project. To download the code, type:

	>> git submodule init
	>> git submodule update

Follow instructions on [VLFEAT](http://www.vlfeat.org) and [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) project pages to install them first. Our code is built on MatConvNet version `1.0-beta19`. To retrieve a particular version of MatConvNet using git, cd to MatConvNet folder and type:

	>> git fetch --tags
	>> git checkout tags/v1.0-beta19
      
Once these are installed edit the `setup.m` to run the corresponding `setup` scripts.

The implementation of the bilinear combination layer in symmetic and assymetic CNNs is included in the [bcnn-package](https://bitbucket.org/tsungyu/bcnn-package). This code contains scripts to fine-tune models and run experiments on several fine-grained recognition datasets. We also provide pre-trained models.


### Pre-trained models

**ImageNet LSVRC 2012 pre-trained models:** We use vgg-m and vgg-verydeep-16 as our basic models. The format of pre-trained models on MatConvnet has evolved continuously. In this project, we use the models in version beta18. Please download the models from matconvnet [pre-trained models](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/beta18/).

**Fine-tuned models:** We provide three B-CNN fine-trained models ([M,M], [D,M], and [D,D]) and SVM models trained on respective bcnn features for each of CUB-200-2011, FGVC Aircraft and Cars dataset. These can be downloaded individually [here](http://maxwell.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/models2). The fine-tuned models for B-CNN with matrix square-root normalization will be added soon.


You can also download all the model files as a tar.gz [here](http://maxwell.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/models2.tar.gz).

### Fine-grained datasets

To run experiments download the datasets from various places and edit the `model_setup.m` file to point it to the location of each dataset. For instance, you can point to the birds dataset directory by setting `opts.cubDir = 'data/cub'`.

### Classification demo

The script `bird_demo` takes an image and runs our pre-trained fine-grained bird classifier to predict the top five species and shows some examples images of the class with the highest score. If you haven't already done so, download our pre-trained [B-CNN [D,M]](http://maxwell.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/models2/bcnn-cub-dm.mat) and [SVM](http://maxwell.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/models2/svm_cub_vdm.mat) models for this demo and locate them in `data/models`. In addition, download the [CUB-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset to `data/cub` as well. You can follow our default setting or edit `opts` in the script to point it to the models and dataset. If you have GPU installed on your machine, set `opts.useGpu=true` to speedup the computation. You should see the following output when you run `bird_demo()`:

	>> bird_demo();
	0.09s to load imdb.
	1.63s to load models into memory.
	Top 5 prediction for test_image.jpg:
	064.Ring_billed_Gull
	059.California_Gull
	147.Least_Tern
	062.Herring_Gull
	060.Glaucous_winged_Gull
	3.80s to make predictions [GPU=0]

To run it on your own images run `bird_demo('imgPath', 'favorite-bird.jpg');`. Classification roughlly takes 4s per image on my laptop on a CPU. On an NVIDIA K40 GPU with bigger batch sizes you should roughly get a throughput of 8 images/second with the `B-CNN [D,M]` model.

### Using B-CNN models
`run_experments.m` extracts B-CNN features and trains a svm classifier on fine-grained categories. Following shows how to setup B-CNN models:

1. Symmetric B-CNN: extracts the self outer-product of features at *'layera'*.
	
        bcnn.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layera', 14,...
           'modelb', [], ...
           'layerb', [],...
        } ;

2. Cross layer B-CNN: extracts the outer-product between features at *'layera'* and *'layerb'* using the same CNN.
	
        bcnn.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layera', 14,...
           'modelb', [], ...
           'layerb', 12,...
        } ;
        

3. Asymmetric B-CNN: extracts the outer-product between features from CNN *'modela'* at *'layera'* and CNN *'modelb'* at *'layerb'*.

        bcnn.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', PRETRAINMODEL_A, ...
           'layera', 30,...
           'modelb', PRETRAINMODEL_B, ...
           'layerb', 14,...
        } ;
        
4. Fine-tuned B-CNN: If you fine-tune a B-CNN network (see next section), you can evaluate the model using:

        bcnn.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', FINE-TUNED_MODEL, ...
           'layera', [],...
           'modelb', [], ...
           'layerb', [],...
        } ;
        
5. B-CNN with matrix square-root:

        impbcnn.opts = {...
           'type', 'impbcnn', ...
           'model', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layer', 14, ...
           'pow', 0.5, ...
           'sigma', 1, ...
           'method', 'schulz', ... % 'schulz' for fast approximation or 'svd' 
           'maxIter', 5, ...   % used for 'schulz' only
        } ;

### Fine-tuning B-CNN models

See `run_experiments_bcnn_train.m` for fine-tuning a B-CNN model. Note that this code caches all the intermediate results during fine-tuning which takes about 200GB disk space.

Here are the steps to fine-tuning a B-CNN [M,M] model on the CUB dataset:

1. Download `CUB-200-2011` dataset (see link above)
1. Edit `opts.cubDir=CUBROOT` in `model_setup.m`, CUBROOT is the location of CUB dataset.
1. Download `imagenet-vgg-m` model (see link above)
1. Set the path of the model in `run_experiments_bcnn_train.m`. For example, set PRETRAINMODEL='data/model/imagenet-vgg-m.mat', to use the Oxford's VGG-M model trained on ImageNet LSVRC 2012 dataset. You also have to set the `bcnnmm.opts` to:

        bcnnmm.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layera', 14,...
           'modelb', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layerb', 14,...
           'shareWeight', true,...
        } ;
        
	The option `shareWeight=true` implies that the blinear model uses the same CNN to extract both features resulting in a symmetric model. For assymetric models set `shareWeight=false`. Note that this roughly doubles the GPU memory requirement. The `cnn_train()` provided from MatConvNet requires the setup of validation set. You need to prepare a validation set for the datasets without pre-defined validation set.

1. Once the fine-tuning is complete, you can train a linear SVM on the extracted features to evaluate the model. See `run_experiments.m` for training/testing using SVMs. You can simply set the MODELPATH to the location of the fine-tuned model by setting MODELPATH='data/ft-models/bcnn-cub-mm.mat' and the `bcnnmm.opts` to:

        bcnnmm.opts = {...
           'type', 'bcnn', ...
           'modela', MODELPATH, ...
           'layera', [],...
           'modelb', [], ...
           'layerb', [],...
        } ;
        
1. And type ``>> run_experiments()`` on the MATLAB command line. The results with be saved in the `opts.resultPath`.

### Fine-tuning B-CNN models with matrix square-root

1. Follow the steps 1 to steps 3 described aboved in `fine-tuning B-CNN models`.
1. Set the path of the model in `run_experiments_bcnn_train.m`. For example, set PRETRAINMODEL='data/model/imagenet-vgg-m.mat', to use the Oxford's VGG-M model trained on ImageNet LSVRC 2012 dataset. You also have to set the `impbcnnm.opts` to:

        impbcnnm.opts = {...
           'type', 'impbcnn', ...
           'model', MODELPATH, ...
           'layer', 14, ...
           'pow', 0.5, ...
           'sigma', 1, ...
           'method', 'svd', ... % 'schulz' for fast approximation or 'svd'
           'bpMethod', 'lyap', ...
           'maxIter', 5, ... % used for 'schulz' only
        } ;
        
	The option `method` specifies the approach to compute the matrix-square root. The `svd`  approach computes the matrix square-root by taking the square-root of eigenvalues and the svd matrices are cached for backward compuation. Thh fast approximation `schulz` by solving Newton iteration is an order-of-magnitude faster during forward pass. However, the backward still requires svd computation and offer no benefit in efficiency during training phase.
    
1. Once the fine-tuning is complete, you can train a linear SVM on the extracted features to evaluate the model. See `run_experiments.m` for training/testing using SVMs. You can simply set the MODELPATH to the location of the fine-tuned model and set the `impbcnnmm.opts` to:

        impbcnnm.opts = {..
           'type', 'impbcnn', ...
           'model', PRETRAINMODEL, ...
           'layer', [], ...
           'pow', 0.5, ...
           'sigma', 1, ...
           'method', 'schulz', ... % 'schulz' for fast approximation or 'svd' 
            'maxIter', 5, ...   % used for 'schulz' only
        } ;
        
1. And type ``>> run_experiments()`` on the MATLAB command line. The results with be saved in the `opts.resultPath`.

### Implementation details

The asymmetric B-CNN model is implemented using two networks whose feature outputs are bilinearly combined followed by normalization and softmax loss layers. The network is constructed using DagNN structure. You can find the details in `initializeNetworksTwoStreams()` and `bcnn_train_dag()`.

When the same network is used to extract both features, the symmetric B-CNN model is implemented as a single network architecture consisting of `bilinearpool`, `sqrt`, and `l2norm` layers on the top of `convolutional` layers. This implementation is about twice as fast and memory efficient than asymmetric implementaion. You can find the details in `initializeNetworkSharedWeights()` and `bcnn_train_simplenn()`.


The code for B-CNN is implemented in the following MATLAB functions:

1. `vl_bilinearnn()	`: This extends `vl_simplenn()` of the MatConvNet library to include the bilinear layers.
1. `vl_nnbilinearpool()`: Bilinear feature pooling with outer product with itself.
1. `vl_nnbilinearclpool()`: Bilinear feature pooling with outer product of two different features. Current version only supports the same resolution of two feature outputs.
1. `vl_nnsqrt()`: Signed square-root normalization.
1. `vl_nnl2norm()`: L2 normalization.

### Running B-CNN on other datasets

The code can be used for other classification datasets as well. You have to implement the corresponding `>> imdb = <dataset-name>_get_database()` function that returns the `imdb` structure in the right format. Take a look at the `cub_get_database.m` file as an example.
